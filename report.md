# DATA201 group project 

### by Cameron Pearce, Peter Nichols, Shaojie Li and Weidou Chen

For this project we decided to create a data model on crashed in Christchurch 

we got the raw data for the crashes in new zealand from
https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/crash-analysis-system-cas-data3/resource/0dfd1ddb-582a-4a21-9cab-298c0b592729

once we found a dataset to work on we filtered the data so that only the crashes that occured in the 
canterbury reigon were in the dataset
