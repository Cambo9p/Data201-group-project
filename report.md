# DATA201 group project 

### by Cameron Pearce, Peter Nichols, Shaojie Li and Weidou Chen

For this project we decided to create a data model on crashed in Christchurch 

1) what data sources did you use? 

we got the raw data for the crashes in new zealand from
https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/crash-analysis-system-cas-data3/resource/0dfd1ddb-582a-4a21-9cab-298c0b592729

once we found a dataset to work on we filtered the data so that only the crashes that occured in the 
canterbury reigon were in the dataset, this was so that the data set was of a reasonable size 


2) Why did we choose these data sources 

3) what target did you chose 

4) what difficulties have you overcome to wrangle the data into the target data model

5) what techniques did you use ?

6) what you managed to achieve and what you failed to do
