13/08/22 - cpe79 {

    created git page, organised to meet other members on friday at 2 

}


14/08/22 - cpe79 {

    met with Shaojie and Weidou and we decided on a project and a data source 
    we decided that we would investigate crashes in chch 
    meeting lasted about an hour

}

15/08/22 - cpe79 {

    worked at home - imported csv file into R and filtered by crashes in chch
    also fixed github things such as documentation, 
    emailed thomas asking for an extension,
    

}

16/08/22 - pni31 
    
    searched for additional data sources to use

16/08/22 - cpe79 {

    refactored bar graph from crash page 
    looking into other datasets to get information from 
    created and started on report 
    created and completed .ipynb files to create the tables for the date model 
}


17/08/22 - cpe79 {

    created relationship diagram and edited code to add fields to the csv files 
    
}

18/08/22 - pni31 {

    data model now creates RDS file 
    created graphs from different files to represent data in visual form
}

18/08/22 - cpe79 {
    started and finished presentation for the data we have collected
    looked into automating the datamodel to update with the newest information 
}

20/08/22 - cpe79 {
	played around with different packages to find a way to automatically download the csv file 
	from the internet 
	began reorganising code as theres too many files that are useless
	automated downloaing of the datamodel
	automated column filtering using regexs to account for a sudden change in variable name for region

	}

21/08/22 - cpe79 {
	worked on automating the creation of the data model 
	-- looked into having one script that runs all of the necessary files to 
	produce the data 
}

23/08/22 - cpe79 {
	looked into 'merging the jupyter notebooks rather than running them all at once 
	as im not sure running them all at once will work since there are notebooks using different kernels 
	- seems to work only when using ipython kernel 

	added content to the project report
}

26/08/22 - cpe79 {
	still trying to find a way to combine the notebooks, i have a way to merge python files but not r files

	finally finished working on the merging of the files 

	added to project report 
	kept working on better ways to automate the data model (regex's to determine what columns are in 
	what files ect) 
}
